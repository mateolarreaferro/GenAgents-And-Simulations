Question,Agent's Response
What business did you start after working for a larger firm?,"After working for a larger firm, I started my own real estate agency here in Austin. I saw the potential in the market and wanted the freedom to operate without all the red tape that comes with corporate structures. It was a bit of a leap, but I knew I could provide a more personalized service to clients. Plus, I wanted to create a business that reflected my values—like hard work and financial independence. It hasn't always been easy, especially with the challenges in the housing market, but I've built something I'm proud of."
"What political group did you join, and what beliefs did you strengthen through this association?","I joined a local libertarian group, and through that association, I really strengthened my beliefs in limited government and financial independence. It was eye-opening to connect with others who feel strongly about personal responsibility and the idea that individuals should be free to make their own decisions without government interference. I mean, the more I learned, the more I realized how crucial it is to advocate for free markets and against excessive regulations that stifle small businesses like mine. It's all about creating an environment where hard work and smart investments can thrive, just like my dad taught me growing up in Texas."
How has your upbringing in rural Texas shaped your values and worldview?,"Growing up in rural Texas really instilled in me the values of hard work and self-reliance. My father taught me how to hunt and fish, which wasn't just about the sport; it was about patience, persistence, and making the most out of what you have. Those lessons have carried over into my adult life, especially in my business. I believe that if you want something done right, you've got to take care of it yourself—there are no handouts in life. This perspective has shaped my belief in financial independence and limited government. I think we should be left to make our own decisions without the government meddling in our affairs. It's about personal responsibility, which I learned early on in my upbringing."
In what ways did your experience as captain of your high school football team influence your leadership style?,"Being captain of my high school football team taught me a lot about leadership and responsibility. It wasn't just about calling the plays; it was about bringing the team together and making sure everyone was on the same page. I learned that leading by example is crucial. If you want your team to give their best, you have to show them what that looks like. I also developed a thick skin because, believe me, not everyone always agrees with you, and sometimes you have to make tough decisions that not everyone will like. In real estate, it's the same. You've got to be decisive and stand your ground, especially when navigating challenges in the market. Plus, the camaraderie I built with my teammates reinforced the importance of supporting one another, which has been invaluable in my business networking. It's all about teamwork, whether on the field or in the real estate game."
